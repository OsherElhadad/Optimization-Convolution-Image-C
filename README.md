# Optimizion Convolution Image- C

This assingment was a competition among all the students in the computer science department at Bar Ilan University. The competiton was to try and make the fastest code for image 
convolution. My code is the only one who recieved 100 and was in the first place. Also, i recieved a bonus for finding and fixing a bug in the original code
that was written by the university.
